# Procedurally Generated Environments for VR Game Development

Working Title: VirtuaBlocks


The goal of this project is to explore the use of procedural generation algorithms to
generate terrain maps for virtual reality game development. This project will consist of a game
developed using the Unity game engine and will apply the Perlin Noise algorithm t0 generate
the in-game terrain using voxels. Additionally, the game will use the Windows Mixed Reality
Toolkit and will be developed and tested using a Samsung Odyssey head mounted display. The
game itself will be a 3d game in which the player is able to move throughout the world as well as
place and destroy block composed of voxels. The player will move about the world from a first
person perspective displayed through the virtual reality headset.

Key Features:
- Procedurally generated world consisting of voxels
- First person perspective via VR headset
- Building and destroying structures

Possible Features:
- VR Motion Controls
- Procedural generation using algorithms other than Perlin Noise
- Enemies
